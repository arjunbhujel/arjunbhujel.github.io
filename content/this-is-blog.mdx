I updated my blog this weekend and wanted to share some thoughts along the way:

- [Content Management](#content-management)

## Content Management

I've moved my content from HTML to vanilla Markdown, to MDX, to a CMS, and back to MDX over the years. My content requirements as of now are:
`

1. Written in Markdown¹
2. Support for syntax highlighting, embedded tweets, and other components
3. Managed through version control²
4. Minimal external dependencies

My goal was to simplify without giving up too many features.

### Retrieving Content

You can go surprisingly far with just Node.js and JavaScript. You'll notice a theme start to emerge in this blog post: fewer dependencies, and more copy/paste-able code.

I removed the following libraries:

- `contentlayer`
- `next-contentlayer`
- `rehype-autolink-headings`
- `rehype-pretty-code`
- `rehype-slug`
- `remark-gfm`
- `shiki`

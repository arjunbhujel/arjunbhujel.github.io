        Hey there! I&apos;m a student of Economics at Tribhuvan University, and
        I&apos;m always bursting with ideas and thoughts on topics like
        Economics, History, Computers, and anything else that catches my fancy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m a self-proclaimed Quasi-UI/UX Designer and Developer, and a
        true Econ Enthusiast. I firmly believe that Economics is the ultimate
        multi-disciplinary subject that connects the dots between History,
        Politics, Math, Computers, and Finance.
